# Building Info

Application for building administrators who want to optimize the costs of building management. It allows obtaining information about the building's parameters of rooms, levels or even the entire buildings.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* Maven 3.2+

        {
          "name": "room1",
          "id": "1",
          "area": "123",
          "volume": "12.3",
          "heatingPowerConsumption": "123.4",
          "illuminationPower": "12"
        },
        {
          "name": "room2",
          "id": "2",
          "area": "123",
